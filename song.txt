Today, I am dirty
I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I'll know that I'm just dirt
Today, I am dirty
I want to be pretty
Tomorrow, I'll know that I'm just dirt
We are the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
When we're dead
They'll know just who we are
We are the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
Yesterday, I was dirty
Wanted to be pretty
I know, now, that I'm forever dirt
Yesterday I was dirty
Wanted to be pretty
I know, now, that I'm forever dirt
We are the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
We are the nobodies
Wanna be somebodies
When we're dead, they'll know just who we are
Some children died the other day
We fed machines and, then, we prayed
Puked up and down in morbid faith
You should have seen the ratings that day
